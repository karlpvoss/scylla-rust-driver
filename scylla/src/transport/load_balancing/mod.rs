//! Load balancing configurations\
//! `Session` can use any load balancing policy which implements the `LoadBalancingPolicy` trait\
//! Policies which implement the `ChildLoadBalancingPolicy` can be wrapped in some other policies\
//! See [the book](https://rust-driver.docs.scylladb.com/stable/load-balancing/load-balancing.html) for more information
